# Project Rock Paper Scissors for The Odin Project (TOP)

I coded a simple 5-round game of the popular Rock Paper Scissors created as part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. 

[Here is the brief](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). There were many impressive solutions, however most opted to present the game as a "First to 5 points wins". For my version, I have chosen to keep it strictly to a 5-round game, according to instructions.
